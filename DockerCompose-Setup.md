# Docker Compose Container Setup

1. Replace image: ```Container image``` with the correct container image
2. Save the dockercompose.yml
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the ```docker-compose.yml``` file.
4. Run the following command to start the container: ```docker-compose up```

This will create a Docker container that mounts the container image to the local storage readonly.
