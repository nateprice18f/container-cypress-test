# VS Code Dev Containers Setup

1. Replace   "image": " ``` <Container name> ``` " with the correct container image
2. Save the devcontainer.json
3. Open the command palette in VS Code by pressing ``` Ctrl+Shift+P ```
4. Type " ```Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container``` " and select it from the list of options
5. Wait for VS Code to build and start the container

This will create a dev container that mounts the container image to the local storage readonly.
